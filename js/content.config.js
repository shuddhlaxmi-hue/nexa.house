      {
        question: "How do I buy a property with Nexa?",
        answer:
          "Buying a property with Nexa is simple: Browse our listings, select your property, connect your Nexa wallet, and initiate the smart contract. Once you transfer the Nexa amount, the smart contract automatically processes the transaction and transfers ownership to you. The entire process takes 10-30 minutes.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is my property ownership legally recognized?",
        answer:
          "Yes, absolutely. Nexa House works with local legal partners in each country to ensure all property transactions comply with local laws. Your blockchain-verified ownership is legally binding and registered with local authorities. You receive both a blockchain certificate and traditional legal documentation.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I don't have enough Nexa?",
        answer:
          "You can purchase Nexa cryptocurrency on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or directly through our integrated exchange partners. We also offer a fiat-to-Nexa conversion service where you can buy Nexa with your credit card or bank transfer within the platform.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I rent out my Nexa House property?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Our platform includes a built-in rental management system. You can list your property for short-term or long-term rentals, set your rates in Nexa, and receive automated payments through smart contracts. Rental income is distributed to your wallet automatically.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the fees compared to traditional real estate?",
        answer:
          "Traditional real estate transactions charge 5-6% in agent fees plus legal costs. Nexa House charges only 1.5% total (0.75% buyer, 0.75% seller). On a $500,000 property, that's $7,500 instead of $30,000+ - saving you over $22,500!",
      },
      {
        question: "How do property inspections work?",
        answer:
          "Each property listing includes professional photos, 3D virtual tours, and detailed inspection reports. For high-value purchases, we can arrange in-person inspections with local partners or virtual live tours with the seller. You can also hire independent inspectors in the property's location.",
      },
      {
        question: "What countries are currently supported?",
        answer:
          "We currently support property transactions in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Bhutan, and the UAE. We're adding new countries monthly - check our roadmap for upcoming regions.",

      {
        question: "Can I sell my property later for fiat currency?",
        answer:
          "Yes! While we encourage Nexa transactions, you can sell your property for traditional currency. Our platform supports both Nexa and fiat conversions. When selling, you can choose to receive payment in Nexa, USD, EUR, or other major currencies.",
